#Mom's Recipes

In memory of my mother Rhona N. Kamoku, this application is to keep her memory alive through cooking and the memories of her associated with them. 

Mom's Recipes stores a library of my mother's recipes that she either cooked or that she loved when I cooked for her. Through the click of a button, a randome recipe renders for the user to cook along with a memory that I have of her associated with the dish. In a way, this is how we keep her alive in our hearts and allow the family to still cook with her.

Mom's Recipes also allow users to add a recipe with their own memory and the ability to search for a specific dish they might be craving if they are not up to letting fate decide what they cook that day.
